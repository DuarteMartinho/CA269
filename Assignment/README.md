Welcome to our project, this project creates a keypad similar to that one found
on any phone.
In order to run this program you will first be required to compile the file. To do so type the following in your terminal.

----------------------------------------------------------------
$ javac Assigment.java
----------------------------------------------------------------

This will create a class file and all thats left to dos is run that file as follows;

----------------------------------------------------------------
$ java Assigment
----------------------------------------------------------------

This will output the following:

Welcome to our phone keypad!
Choose what you want to do!
1 - List all letter combinations
2 - Digits to Words
3 - Credits
4 - Quit
Your desired option: 

**If user inputs 1:
Here if you input any numbers that are not 0 or 1 from 2-9 this will print all the possible combinations that can be made using a keypad with those entered numbers.

**If user inputs 2:
Here you can input any number from 0-9 this will print the actual letter/word and you can seperate the letters to get your desired letter/word using a 0 or a 1.

Example:
Please enter your digits to print a word: 20220222
Output will be:
Your word is: abc

**If user inputs 3:
This will list the credits of the group members and their student number.

The program will run continuously until you exit it and to do so simply choose the 4th option:

**If user inputs 4:
This will exit the program.

Used Live Share extension on Visual Studio Code to be able to work as a group at the same time. We all equally contributed and worked each part of the code sharing thoughts and ideas and testing code using a shared terminal.
